wedding-play
============

A Javascript-based Wedding 'play' from http://www.jellofund.net/play. It tells
the story about how my wife and I met. It was written as one-time-use code so
don't blame me too much for the ugly parts.

Note that unfortunately the resources were borrowed from a number of places, so
they aren't included here. If you want to see the original you can go the
webpage mentioned above.
